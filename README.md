# Writer App

## Goals

Create a minimalist writer app with the following features:

- Change background color (or with image)
- Change text font, size, color
- Choose from different visual effects
- Turn on/off a typing sound effect
- Text-to-speech

The main goal of this is to use Sass and Typescript in a React app to make a pleasureable writing experience that creates similar feedback to stimming or ASMR, both visually and aurally. Having a built in text-to-speech feature also makes it easy to hear what you've written. 

## To Do

## Questions
